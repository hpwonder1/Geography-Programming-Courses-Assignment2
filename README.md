# Geography-Programming-Courses-Assignment2
## Project Description
The assignment2 is about designing and building a model, application, or analysis from scratch. From the project ideas, I chose the [Site location problem](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/courses/computing/study/core-python/assessment2/best.html) as my project idea. 
## Usage
1. Download the codes by using git or directly download zip from github.
2. Run it on your jupyter notebook.
## Directory Structure
 - tkinter.ipynb (the code for the model)
 - data (the folder including all evironment files)
 - index.html (the HTML page generated from tkinter.ipynb)
 - plot.txt (the raster style comma-separated text saved from the model)
 - plot_demo.gif (the gif shows the workflow of the model)
